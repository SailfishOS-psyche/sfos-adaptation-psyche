# sfos-adaptation-vayu

With this adaptation, sailfish os is no longer tied to the android version installed on the phone, the modified LineageOS 18.1 is used as a basis.
After installing sailfishos.zip and adaptation.zip, in your sdcard will be created by droid-boot.img, droid-dtbo.img, hybrid-boot.img and hybris-dtbo.img. By flashing them through the recovery to the appropriate partition, you will be able to switch between sailfishos/android.

For SailfishOS to work, your /data partition does not need to be encrypted!!!
